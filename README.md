AAFaceDetection: Visage
===============
Approachable implementation of iOS FaceDetection with CIDetector for prototyping based on NSNotification.

###Introduction
Although face-recognition was first introduced to the platform by Apple in iOS 5, we haven't seen much creative use of this quite interesting feature, especially on live video. This technology is especially interesting for prototyping experimental user-interfaces that make use of the user's emotion (smiling, blinking or winking) or detect the user's attention (whether he is looking at the screen or not). That's why I wanted to make it as easy as possible to prototype those interactions with a simple model based on NSNotification whenever the status of the user's face changes. All the main features of Apples CIDetector(ofType: CIDetectorTypeFace‚Ä¶) are implemented and can be easily accessed.

###Usage
To start using "AAFaceDetection/Visage" just drag the "Visage".swift" file into your project folder.

Visage is instantiated by passing a camera-position and a optimization setting for performance like this:
```
let visage = Visage(cameraPosition: Visage.CameraDevice.FaceTimeCamera, optimizeFor: Visage.DetectorAccuracy.HigherPerformance)
```

For *cameraPosition* the possible options are:
* `.ISightCamera`, which uses the back-facing camera of the iPhone or iPad.
* `.FaceTimeCamera`, which uses the front-facing camera of the iPhone or iPad.

For *optimizeFor* the possible options are:
* `.HigherPerformance`, which sets CIDetectorAccuracy to CIDetectorAccuracyHigh.
* `.BatteryLife`, which sets CIDetectorAccuracy to CIDetectorAccuracyLow. (also recommended on older devices)

As I said earlier Visage is based on sending NSNotifications as this is one of the easiest to grasp principles (at least it was for me) for beginners and it basically just works. You can subscribe to a number of events:

* `visageNoFaceDetectedNotification` fires whenever there has been no face detected.
* `visageFaceDetectedNotification` fires whenever there has been a face detected. üòê
* `visageHasSmileNotification` fires when the user is smiling. üòÉ
* `visageHasNoSmileNotification` fires when the user stopped smiling.
* `visageBlinkingNotification` fires when the user is blinking. (2 eyes closed at once)
* `visageNotBlinkingNotification` fires when the user stopped blinking. (at least one eye opened)
* `visageWinkingNotification` fires when the user is winking. (1 eye closed) üòâ
* `visageNotWinkingNotification` fires when the user stopped winking. (2 eyes opened or closed)
* `visageLeftEyeClosedNotification` fires when the user closed the left eye.
* `visageLeftEyeOpenNotification` fires when the user opened the left eye.
* `visageRightEyeClosedNotification` fires when the user closed the right eye.
* `visageRightEyeOpenNotification` fires when the user opened the right eye.

You can subscribe to these events by using one of the provided methods `NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObsever*`. In the example I'm using the completionBlock but you can use any of the three provided functions and simply pass a selector.

By default these notifications are fired only when the status changes. There is however the option to receive a continuous stream of notifications, which may be handy for some purposes, which can be activated by setting `        visage!.onlyFireNotificatonOnStatusChange = false`. 
Keep in mind that this setting will likely decrease performance.

Visage also provides a previewView of the camera-image as this is something you would often want. Just add it to your view hierarchy like this: `self.view.addSubview(visage!.visageCameraView)`.
